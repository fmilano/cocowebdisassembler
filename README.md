# A web based disassembler for the Color Computer
An experimental web based linear disassembler for the Motorola 6809/Hitachi 6309 on the Color Computer platform. 

The main objectives of this project are:
* Experimenting with web based GUI development without any major framework; at the moment only jQuery is used.
* Writing a linear disassembler from scratch, but generating an intermediate decomposition structure that could be used for further code analysis. The decomposition structure is loosely based on ideas from [diStorm](https://github.com/gdabah/distorm/wiki/DecomposeInterface).


Try a [live version]([diStorm](https://fmilano.github.io/cocowebdisassembler/index.html) of the application.
